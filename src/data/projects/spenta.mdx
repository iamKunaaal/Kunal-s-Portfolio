## Why I Built This

I built this platform to solve fundamental challenges in real estate customer management:

- **Scattered Customer Data:** No centralized system to track customer interactions across multiple properties
- **Manual Lead Management:** Sales teams relied on spreadsheets and manual processes
- **Property-Specific Workflows:** Each property needed unique customer handling and branding
- **Compliance Requirements:** RERA regulations demanded proper documentation and tracking
- **Sales Pipeline Visibility:** Management lacked real-time insights into sales performance
- **Customer Experience:** No seamless way for customers to provide information and track their enquiries

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Django 5.2
- Python
- SQLite (Development)
- Django REST Framework concepts

### Frontend
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

### Infrastructure
